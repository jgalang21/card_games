# Object Oriented Design Term Project

This project contains three different card games. It contains war, multiplayer 52 pickup and singleplayer 52 pickup. 

Initially, we were provided with a multiplayer game of 52 pickup. Our goal was to implement the singleplayer version of the game and war by making the **least** amount of changes necessary.
